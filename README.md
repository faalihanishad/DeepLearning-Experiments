MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification using a CNN

ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project demonstrates a classic computer vision task: classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits from 0 to 9.

This implementation is a foundational example of how CNNs can be used for image classification tasks. It covers the complete workflow, from loading and preprocessing the data to building, training, and evaluating the model.

âœ¨ Features

Dataset: Uses the standard MNIST dataset, which is automatically downloaded.

Data Preprocessing: Includes reshaping, normalization, and one-hot encoding for optimal model performance.

Model Architecture: A sequential CNN model with multiple convolutional, max-pooling, and dense layers.

Training: Trains the model on 60,000 training images and validates on a subset of that data.

Evaluation: Measures the final accuracy of the trained model on 10,000 unseen test images.

Clear Output: Prints the model summary and final test accuracy to the console.
